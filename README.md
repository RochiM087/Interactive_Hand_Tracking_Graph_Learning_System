This code combines real-time hand tracking with concepts of Uniformly Accelerated Linear Motion.

== IMPORTING LIBRARIES

	import mediapipe as mp
	import cv2
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

The code begins by importing three essential libraries:
- cv2 (OpenCV) for image manipulation, video capture, and image processing.
- mediapipe for real-time hand detection. This library provides powerful functionalities for hand tracking.
- matplotlib.pyplot for creating and updating real-time graphs.

== draw_graph() FUNCTION

	def draw_graph(x, y):
   
		plt.clf()  
    	plt.plot(x, y, '-')  
    	plt.xlabel('Time')
    	plt.ylabel('Position')
    	plt.title('Position vs. Time')
    	plt.pause(0.001)  
   
This function is responsible for creating and updating a real-time graph. It takes two lists as input: x (time) and y (position).

- plt.clf() clears the previous graph, allowing continuous updates.
- plt.plot(x, y, '-') creates a line graph with time on the x-axis and position on the y-axis.
- plt.xlabel, plt.ylabel, and plt.title set labels for the axes and the graph's title.
- plt.pause(0.001) pauses for a brief period to update the graph.

== track_hand_and_car() FUNCTION

	def track_hand_and_car():
    mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
   	mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands

    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Initialize the camera
    
    # ... Loading images of the car and track ...

    # Initialize the MediaPipe hand detector
    with mp_hands.Hands(static_image_mode=False, max_num_hands=1, min_detection_confidence=0.5) as hands:
        x_values = []
        y_values = []
        time_values = []
        history_points = []
        reset_graph = False

        while cap.isOpened():
            success, image = cap.read()  # Read a frame from the camera

            if not success:
                print("Error reading the frame")
                break

            # ... Image preprocessing and manipulation ...

            # Process the image with the MediaPipe hand detector
            results = hands.process(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))

            if results.multi_hand_landmarks and len(results.multi_hand_landmarks) > 0:
                hand_landmarks = results.multi_hand_landmarks[0]  # Select the first detected hand
                # ... Hand tracking and processing ...

            # ... Display the image with tracking and update the graph ...

            # Check if the 'R' key was pressed to reset the graph
            if reset_graph:
                x_values = []
                y_values = []
                time_values = []
                history_points = []
                reset_graph = False

            # Check if the 'Q' key was pressed to terminate the process
            if key & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                break
    
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

- track_hand_and_car() is the core function of the project, responsible for real-time hand tracking and updating the position vs. time graph.
- The mediapipe and cv2 libraries are configured for hand detection and image manipulation.
- A while loop is initiated to capture real-time camera frames.
- The captured image is processed by the MediaPipe hand detector.
- Coordinates of the detected hand are extracted and normalized to represent hand position on the screen.
- Hand position is overlaid with a virtual car.
- Position and time data are collected and used to update the graph.
- The 'R' key resets the graph, while 'Q' terminates the process.

This code exemplifies the integration of hand tracking techniques and real-time graphical representation to demonstrate concepts of Uniformly Accelerated Linear Motion (UALM) in an interactive and educational manner.
